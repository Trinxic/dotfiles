# Stownt (Don't Stow)
Items within this directory will not be automatically sym-linked by the `stow .` command while in `~/dotfiles`.

Other files outside of `/stownt` may directly use content within this directory without the need for sym-links (Ex. `/wallpapers`).

On linux, Firefox sym-links will be added when running the `~/dotfiles/setup.sh` script.
